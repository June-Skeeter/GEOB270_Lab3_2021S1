# Generate Maps & Reports

Create a map showing the roads at risk and the Inundation Zone.  Use the symbology to classify by road types arterial roads, and display the inundation layer in a transparent shade of blue.

## Question 15)
Upload Map 1 to canvas.

## Map 2

Create a map showing the Inundation Zone and the properties at risk (not the output from the properties erase), classified by ZoneCode.  

## Question 16)
Upload Map 2 to canvas.

## Map 3

Create a map showing the Inundation Zone, Population_at_Risk_Clip layer classified by Population, and the Shelters layer with graduated symbols classified by capacity.

## Question 17)
Upload Map 3 to canvas.

## Report
Write a report for the City of Port Alberin.  The report should briefly summarize the analysis steps you used to conduct the Tsunami Risk Assessment.  Reference your maps where applicable and also reference statistics where necessary (eg. the lenght of different road types in the Inundation Zone).  The report needs to answer these key questions:

1) How many people within Port Alberni and the surrounding area are potentially living in areas at risk?
<!-- 7,496 -->
<!--   7,046 (population at risk after clipped by residential properties at risk) -->

<!-- the population at risk: 13515 total and 6151 residential -->

2) Which properties in the city are at risk?  And specifically, how many residential properties are at risk?
<!-- 977 residential, 1431 total -->
<!-- 699 residential, 1,081 total (count number of rows of the properties_at_risk layer) -->
<!-- Properties at risk: 1431 total and 937 residential.  -->


3) Which roadways are expected to be flooded or damaged in the event of a Tsunami?
<!-- See Map -->
4) Does the city need to build more Tusnami Warning Sirens?
<!-- No, the existing infrastructure is sufficient -->
5) Are the proposed capacities and locations of the three Tsunami Shelters sufficient?
<!-- Capacity needs to be approximately doubled or more shelters should be built. -->

You might find it useful to display some statistics as tables.  Make sure the report answers the five questions posed by the City at the beginning of the project and give any recommendations you may have.
