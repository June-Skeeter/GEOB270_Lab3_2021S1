# Framing the Problem

Just off of the West Coast of Vancouver Island, is the [Canadia Subduction Zone (CSZ)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascadia_subduction_zone). Until recently, the common scientific theory was that the CSZ was incapable of producing megathrust earthquakes and their associated Tsunami’s because “no sizable earthquake has occurred on it since European settlement began” (Ludwin et al. 2005).

Despite the scientific communities’ assumptions that the CSZ was not a threat, knowledge of the destructive potential of the CSZ was preserved in the oral histories of coastal indigenous peoples from British Columbia to Northern California.  There are numerous histories describing a massive earthquake and tsunami that occurred sometime around 1700.  These histories were transcribed between 1860 and 1964.  Read the highlighted sections of Ludwin et al. (2005) that was provided in the Lab3_Data folder.

It wasn’t until the 1990’s that scientific research began to shown that the CSZ was capable of producing megathrust earthquakes and tsunamis.  Tree ring studies and historical accounts of a Tsunami in Japan pinpoint the timing of the last major CSZ earthquake at 21:00 Pacific time on January 26, 1700.  In fact, there have been at least seven megathrust earthquakes exceeding 8.0 magnitude in the last 3500 years.  The recurrence interval for massive earthquakes along this fault line are estimated to be between 243 and 500 years.  In 2010, geologists predicted a 37% chance of a magnitude 8.2+ event within 50 years, and a 10 to 15% chance that the entire Cascadia subduction zone will rupture with a magnitude 9+ event within the same time frame.  

This example highlights both the arrogance of the scientific community and the lack of value it has historically attributed to traditional knowledge.

## Question 1)
What does the above example presented in Ludwin et al. 2005 say about the value that the sciences have historically attributed to traditional knowledge in when it comes to understanding our world? 

## Unique Geography

On March 28th, 1964 a megathrust earthquake (9.2 magnitude on the Richter scale) occurred in southern Alaska.  Known as the “Good Friday” earthquake, it was responsible for 131 deaths: 9 from the earthquake itself, and 122 from the subsequent Tsunami, reaching as far away as Crescent City, California.  In British Columbia, the Tsunami’s impacts were most devastating in Port Alberni, where 55 homes were washed away and 375 more were damaged.  Port Alberni is especially vulnerable to Tsunamis because of its specific geography.  Located at the head of 40km long fjord, Tsunami waves are amplified as they are funneled up the fjord.  Read the highlighted portions of the introduction section in Fine et al (2008) that was provided in the Lab3_Data folder for some context.  You can also watch the Simulation shown below for a visualization of what is going on.

## Question 2)
The maximum wave height recorded at Tofino was only ____ meters.  Despite this, wave heights exceeded 8 meters in Port Alberni.  

## Question 3)
Look back at Ludwin et al. 2005, specifically at the story of Pachena Bay (bottom pg 142 to top of pg 143).  You can find a [full transcription here](https://pnsn.org/outreach/native-american-stories/other-stories/the-tsunami-at-anaqtl-a-or-pachena-bay).  Find Pachena Bay on google maps.  Where is it relative to Port Alberni?  What can you infer from this story about how a megathrust earthquake occurring just off of the coast of Vancouver Island would impact Port Alberni? 

## Defining the Project Area

In light of this research, the city of Port Alberni submitted an application for funding to update their Tsunami warning and response infrastructure.  The city was recently granted funding and has hired you as a GIS consultant to assess the potential impacts of an 8.5 magnitude earthquake occurring directly off the west coast of Vancouver Island that would produce an estimated wave height of 10 meters.

The city wants to know:

    How many people are potentially living in areas at risk?  Specifically how many children and seniors?
    Which properties in the city are at risk?  And specifically, how many residential properties are at risk?
    Which roadways are expected to be flooded or damaged in the event of a Tsunami?
    Does the city need to build more Tusnami Warning Sirens?
    Are the proposed capacities and locations of the three Tsunami Shelters sufficient?
