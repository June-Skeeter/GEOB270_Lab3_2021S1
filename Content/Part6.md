# Generate Maps & Reports


## Export Your Model

In your model window, hit Auto Layout one more time.  Then click export and save your model as PA_RiskAssesment.pdf  *Note* Make sure you save your output as a .pdf, not a .svg file!

## Question 14)
Upload your model to canvas.

<!-- Credit if it looks like (see final model.pdf on content page), if steps are mixed up/missing, point it out and take off.-->

## Map 1

Create a map showing the roads at risk and the Inundation Zone.  Use the symbology to classify by road types arterial roads, and display the inundation layer in a transparent shade of blue.

## Question 15)
Upload Map 1 to canvas.


<!-- They've had a lecture on cartography at this pt.  So each map should "look nice".  Reference this video for the pointers I gave them: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UecvTwUGtCY  for repeated mistakes in 1,2,&3 is OK
Cartography: color choices decent, all map elements (including source statement), error free and descriptive text, bc albers projection (if they left things in just the WGS 1984 GCS [coordinate system [simply analytics comes in this], things will look a bit stretched out) -10 pts
Content: Inundation zone (w/ transparency) + roads (arterial categorized separately) -5pts
 -->

## Map 2

Create a map showing the Inundation Zone and the properties at risk (not the output from the properties erase), classified by ZoneCode.  


## Question 16)
Upload Map 2 to canvas.

<!-- They've had a lecture on cartography at this pt.  So each map should "look nice".  Reference this video for the pointers I gave them: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UecvTwUGtCY  for repeated mistakes in 1,2,&3 is OK
Cartography: same as above -10 pts
Content: Inundation zone (w/ transparency) + properties at risk (by zone code (not just residential!))  -5pts
 -->


## Map 3

Create a map showing the Inundation Zone, Population_at_Risk_Clip layer classified by Population, and the Shelters layer with graduated symbols classified by capacity (reference lab 1 if you forgot how to do graduated point symbols).



## Question 17)
Upload Map 3 to canvas.

<!-- They've had a lecture on cartography at this pt.  So each map should "look nice".  Reference this video for the pointers I gave them: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UecvTwUGtCY  for repeated mistakes in 1,2,&3 is OK
Cartography: same as above - 5 pts
Content: Inundation zone (w/ transparency) + population at risk clip at risk (classified by population) + shelters w/ graduated symbols - 10 pts
 -->

## Report
Write a brief (1-2 page) report for the City of Port Alberin.  The report should briefly introduce the problem, summarize the analysis steps you used to conduct the Tsunami Risk Assessment, and explain your findings.  Reference your model and maps where applicable and also reference statistics where necessary (eg. the length of different road types in the Inundation Zone).  The report needs to answer these key questions:

1) How many people within Port Alberni and the surrounding area are potentially living in areas at risk?
<!-- 6,474 -->

2) Which properties in the city are at risk?  And specifically, how many residential properties are at risk?
<!-- 1413 total, 971 residential -->

3) Which roadways are expected to be flooded or damaged in the event of a Tsunami?
<!-- 8.432 km arterial, 64.3683 total -->

4) Does the city need to build more Tusnami Warning Sirens?
<!-- No, the existing infrastructure is sufficient -->

5) Are the proposed capacities and locations of the three Tsunami Shelters sufficient?
<!-- Capacity (3500) needs to be increased (6500) or more shelters should be built. -->

## Question 18)
Upload your report to canvas.

<!-- Needs to explain results & answer each question (see above^) (10 pts - 2 each) + introduction/summary of problem (5pts) + explain steps (5pts)-->
