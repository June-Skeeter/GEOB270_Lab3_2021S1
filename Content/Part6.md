## Report
Write a brief (1-2 page) report for the City of Port Alberin.  The report should briefly introduce the problem, summarize the analysis steps you used to conduct the Tsunami Risk Assessment, and explain your findings.  Reference your model and maps where applicable and also reference statistics where necessary (eg. the length of different road types in the Inundation Zone).  The report needs to answer these key questions:

1) How many people within Port Alberni and the surrounding area are potentially living in areas at risk?
<!-- 6,474 -->

2) Which properties in the city are at risk?  And specifically, how many residential properties are at risk?
<!-- 1413 total, 971 residential -->

3) Which roadways are expected to be flooded or damaged in the event of a Tsunami?
<!-- 8432.38108989368 -->

4) Does the city need to build more Tusnami Warning Sirens?
<!-- No, the existing infrastructure is sufficient -->

5) Are the proposed capacities and locations of the three Tsunami Shelters sufficient?
<!-- Capacity needs to be increased or more shelters should be built. -->
