## Map 3

## Report
Write a report for the City of Port Alberin.  The report should briefly summarize the analysis steps you used to conduct the Tsunami Risk Assessment.  Reference your maps where applicable and also reference statistics where necessary (eg. the lenght of different road types in the Inundation Zone).

Watch the video for pointers on summary tables. (Links to an external site.)

You might find it useful to display some statistics as tables.  Make sure the report answers the five questions posed by the City at the beginning of the project and give any recommendations you may have.
